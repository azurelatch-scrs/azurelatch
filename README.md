| macOS | Ventura+ | Partial, no auto GK on ARM |

This table covers the basics; for specifics, refer to our GitHub issues.

## System Requirements

To run smoothly, meet these minimum specs. 🔧 Azure is lightweight, but optimal performance needs decent hardware.

Configuring the script is where the magic happens. Use the in-built menu or edit the Lua code directly. Here's a sample bash-like snippet for setup (though it's Lua, we'll simulate):

```lua

getgenv().AzureLatch = {
    InfSpin = true,  -- Enable azure latch script inf spin
    AutoFarm = false, -- Toggle auto farm azure latch script
    AutoGK = true,
    -- Add more here
}
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://pastebin.com/raw/abc123"))()
```

Detailed text: Start by opening the executor console. Paste the config block above, adjusting booleans for features like azure latch script auto gk. For advanced users, add variables for speed multipliers. Table below for common configs:
